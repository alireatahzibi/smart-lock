# Smart Lock Project

A practical and educational smart lock system based on Arduino, designed for secure and flexible door access. This project is ideal for students and engineers interested in electronics, embedded systems, and security applications.

---

## 🧩 **Features**

- **PIN-based authentication** using a 4x4 Matrix Keypad  
- **Servo motor** or Relay-based physical locking mechanism  
- Modular code, easy to upgrade (e.g., add RFID, Bluetooth, IoT features)  
- Fully documented wiring and source code  
- Focus on hands-on learning and practical implementation  
- Suitable for academic demonstration and prototyping

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### **Required Hardware**
- Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- 4x4 Matrix Keypad
- Servo motor (or relay module)
- Jumper wires, breadboard, power supply

### **Installation**
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-lock
    ```
2. Open the code using Arduino IDE.
3. Connect the hardware as described in the `/docs/wiring.png`.
4. Upload the sketch to your Arduino board.

### **How to Use**
- Power up the Arduino.
- Enter the correct PIN on the keypad to unlock the door (default: `1234`).
- Wrong codes will not trigger the unlock mechanism.

## 📦 **Planned Future Upgrades**

- **RFID authentication** (using MFRC522 module)
- **Bluetooth or WiFi control** (link to mobile app)
- Security features: logging, brute-force protection, user management
- PCB design and custom enclosure
